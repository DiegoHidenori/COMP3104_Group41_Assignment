Learning DevOps is essential in the software development cycle as it bridges the gap between development and operations, streamlining collaboration, automation, and faster delivery.
 By implementing continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and security measures early in the process, DevOps improves software quality, scalability, and reduces time to market, making it a valuable skill for modern developers.
