Learning DevOps is essential in the software development cycle as it bridges the gap between development and operations, streamlining collaboration, automation, and faster delivery.
 By implementing continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and security measures early in the process, DevOps improves software quality, scalability, and reduces time to market, making it a valuable skill for modern developers.
2- Bridging the Gap Between Development and Operations
Traditionally, development and operations teams worked in silos, often leading to delays in software delivery. DevOps emphasizes collaboration between these teams, which helps in faster and more efficient deployment of applications.
3- Automation of Processes
DevOps encourages automation at various stages of the development cycle, such as code testing, integration, and deployment. This reduces manual errors, speeds up repetitive tasks, and ensures that systems are more reliable and scalable.
