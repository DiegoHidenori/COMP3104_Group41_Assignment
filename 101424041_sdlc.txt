Learning about DevOps is critical in the software development cycle 
because it shortens the distance between development and operations, 
making releases faster and more reliable. It facilitates automation, 
collaboration, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), 
increasing efficiency, reducing errors, and improving the overall 
quality and speed of software deployment.
